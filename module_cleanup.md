# EDSL Module Cleanup Plan

This document outlines the process for systematically cleaning up each major sub-module of the EDSL codebase by addressing unit test warnings, doctest issues, linting errors, import patterns, and exception handling.

## Major Sub-Modules

Based on the codebase structure, these are the major sub-modules to address:

1. `agents`
2. `base`
3. `buckets`
4. `caching`
5. `config`
6. `conversation`
7. `coop`
8. `dataset`
9. `display`
10. `inference_services`
11. `instructions`
12. `interviews`
13. `invigilators`
14. `jobs`
15. `key_management`
16. `language_models`
17. `notebooks`
18. `plugins`
19. `prompts`
20. `questions`
21. `results`
22. `scenarios`
23. `surveys`
24. `tasks`
25. `tokens`
26. `utilities`

## Cleanup Process

For each sub-module, perform the following steps:

1. Run unit tests to identify and fix any warnings
2. Run doctests to identify and fix any issues
3. Run the ruff linter to identify and fix any linting issues
4. Check that only relative imports are used within the module
5. Ensure all exceptions raised are properly defined in the module's `exceptions.py` file and inherit from a base exception

## Commands Reference

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Run tests for a specific module
pytest -xv tests/<module_name>

# Check test coverage
poetry run coverage run -m pytest tests/<module_name>
poetry run coverage report -m edsl/<module_name>/*
```

### Doctests
```bash
# Using run_doctests.py
python run_doctests.py -v <module_name>

# Or using pytest
pytest --doctest-modules edsl/<module_name>
```

### Linting
```bash
# Run ruff linter on a specific module
poetry run ruff check edsl/<module_name>
```

### Check Imports
```bash
# Find absolute imports within the EDSL package
grep -r "from edsl" edsl/<module_name>
```

### Check Exceptions
```bash
# Find raised exceptions that aren't from the module's exceptions.py
grep -r "raise " edsl/<module_name> | grep -v "exceptions\."
```

## Progress Checklist

### Agents Module Report

#### Summary:
- Initial Test Coverage: 62% overall (agent.py: 65%, agent_list.py: 47%, descriptors.py: 96%, exceptions.py: 88%)
- Improved Test Coverage: agent_list.py increased from 47% to 80%
- All unit tests are passing with minor unrelated warnings
- All doctests are passing
- Linting checks pass
- Found some issues with imports and exception handling

#### Issues Examined:
1. **Exception Handling:**
   - ❌ Initially replaced AttributeError with AgentAttributeError, but reverted due to issues with agent operations
   - ⚠️ Documentation shows that AttributeError is used intentionally to maintain compatibility with Python's attribute access mechanism

#### Issues Resolved:
1. **Test Coverage Gaps:**
   - ✅ Improved test coverage for agent_list.py from 47% to 80%
   - ✅ Added tests for many previously untested methods including shuffle, sample, duplicate, rename, select, filter, all_traits, from_csv, translate_traits, remove_trait, add_trait, set_codebook, and cartesian product

2. **Import Issues:**
   - ✅ Confirmed that docstring examples with absolute imports are intentional (they demonstrate how users would import the library)
   - ✅ Confirmed that "from edsl" imports in code generation methods are intentional as they produce code for end users

#### Next Steps:
- Focus on remaining untested sections in agent_list.py (lines 30, 39, 180, 215, 219, 222, 281, 331-335, 342, 356-358, 367, 420, 423, 452-459, 483-500, 605-606)
- Consider improving test coverage for agent.py (currently at 65%)

### Surveys Module Report

#### Summary:
- Initial Test Coverage: 50% overall (main files), 79% (subdirectories)
- Low Coverage Areas: 
  - survey_css.py (0%)
  - translate.py (0%)
  - survey_export.py (28%)
  - survey_flow_visualization.py (37%)
- All unit tests are passing with minor warnings
- Found 7 doctest failures across 3 files
- Linting found one issue (E731) in translate.py
- Found numerous absolute imports and non-exception module exceptions

#### Issues Examined:
1. **Doctest Failures:**
   - rule.py: Rule.show_ast_tree() getting mismatch in the AST output representation
   - survey.py: Survey.to_jobs() output format mismatch
   - survey.py: Survey.by() failures with exact matching issues
   - survey_css.py: CSSRule.to_dict() and SurveyCSS.to_dict() version number issues
   - survey_export.py: SurveyExport.code() output format mismatch

2. **Import Issues:**
   - Many absolute imports are used in doctest examples (intentional)
   - Several absolute imports in actual module code that should be relative

3. **Exception Handling:**
   - Many exceptions are raised without using the module's exceptions.py
   - Direct use of Python built-in exceptions (ValueError, TypeError)
   - Multiple custom exceptions not defined in exceptions.py

#### Issues Resolved:
1. **Test Coverage:**
   - Identified critical areas with low coverage
   - Fully covered Memory module shows good testing practices to follow

2. **Linting Issues:**
   - Identified lambda assignment in translate.py that should be converted to def

3. **Warnings Handling:**
   - Identified rule.py warnings about converting old syntax to Jinja2 style

#### Next Steps:
- Create tests for survey_css.py (currently 0% coverage)
- Create tests for translate.py (currently 0% coverage)
- Improve test coverage for survey_export.py (currently at 28%)
- Fix the doctest failures by updating doctest expected outputs
- Convert the lambda in translate.py to a proper function definition
- Convert absolute imports to relative imports in actual code (not doctest examples)
- Move custom exceptions to exceptions.py

## Notes

* For each issue found, document the problem and solution implemented
* Pay special attention to compatibility between fixes to ensure changes in one module don't break functionality in another
* After completing all modules, run a full test suite to verify overall functionality

### Import Guidelines
* Within a module: Use relative imports (e.g., `from .submodule import X`)
* Cross-module imports: Use absolute imports (e.g., `from edsl.other_module import Y`)

### Exception Handling Guidelines
* All exceptions should be defined in the module's `exceptions.py` file
* Each exception should inherit from the module's base exception
* Module base exceptions should inherit from `edsl.base.exceptions.BaseException`
* Never raise Python's built-in exceptions directly (e.g., `ValueError`, `TypeError`)
* Instead, create custom exceptions that inherit from the module's base exception
