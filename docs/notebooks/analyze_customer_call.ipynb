    "# Analyzing a transcript\n",
    "This notebook provides example EDSL code for analyzing a transcript using AI.\n",
    "In the steps below we construct a survey of questions about a transcript of a fictional call between a business development representative and a potential customer, and then use a language model to answer the questions in the persona of an business development expert delivering feedback on the call.\n",
    "The code can easily be modified for purposes of analyzing other textual content, images, PDFs, websites, tables and other data types with diverse personas and many popular language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "[EDSL is an open-source library](https://github.com/expectedparrot/edsl) for simulating surveys, experiments and other research with AI agents and large language models. \n",
    "Before running the code below, please ensure that you have [installed the EDSL library](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/installation.html) and either [activated remote inference](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/remote_inference.html) from your [Coop account](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/coop.html) or [stored API keys](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/api_keys.html) for the language models that you want to use with EDSL.

    "Hi, Jamie! Thanks so much for taking the time to chat today. How’s everything going with your website?\n",
    "\n",
    "Jamie (Customer):\n",
    "Hi, Alex. It’s going okay, I think. We’re getting some users, but honestly, I’m just trying to figure out the best way to manage payments. It’s all new to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alex:\n",
    "Got it, no worries! Quick can really help simplify things for you. Our platform allows you to accept payments easily and has a subscription option, which I think you mentioned you were interested in, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "Jamie:\n",
    "Yeah, we’re thinking about offering different subscription levels for our software, but I’m not sure how to set it all up. And we have some international users, so that’s been a bit confusing too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alex:\n",
    "Right, right. So, with Quick, you can definitely do subscriptions, and it handles multiple currencies, too. For example, if you have a customer in Europe, Quick can automatically handle the conversion. It’s designed to make that part easy, so you don’t need to worry too much about different currencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jamie:\n",
    "That sounds helpful. But I’m a bit concerned about the setup. I’m not a developer, so I’m worried this might be too complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alex:\n",
    "Oh, yeah, I totally understand! Quick’s setup is meant to be as easy as possible. We have plugins and a lot of guides to walk you through it. I’d say that most people get it up and running without too much trouble. And if you do need help, our support team is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jamie:\n",
    "Okay, that’s a relief. I’ve heard some stories about people getting stuck for weeks with payment systems. I don’t want that to happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alex:\n",
    "I get that completely. We try to make it as straightforward as possible. Also, if you’re worried about fraud or security, Quick has a feature called Shield that helps detect fraud. It’s built in, so it’s automatically protecting you from day one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jamie:\n",
    "Oh, that sounds good. I don’t know much about fraud detection. Is it something I’d have to set up?\n",
    "\n",
    "Alex:\n",
    "Nope! Shield is on by default, so you don’t have to configure anything special unless you want to. It uses machine learning to detect unusual activity based on data from many transactions, which helps catch fraudulent transactions without much work on your end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jamie:\n",
    "That’s nice to know. What about fees? I’d like to have a clear idea of what this will cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alex:\n",
    "Absolutely. So, Quick charges 2.9% plus 30 cents per transaction. For subscriptions, there’s no extra fee beyond the normal transaction cost. Also, if you start processing a lot of payments, we do offer some discounts, but those kick in at a higher volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jamie:\n",
    "Alright, that makes sense. And what about invoicing? A few customers have asked about getting invoices instead of just a credit card charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alex:\n",
    "Yes, we can do that too. With Quick Invoicing, you can send out one-time or recurring invoices, which is nice if you have larger clients who prefer an invoice. It’s all within the Quick system, so it integrates well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jamie:\n",
    "Good to know. I think this covers most of my questions. It sounds like Quick could be a good fit. I’d just need to make sure I’m able to actually set it up without a ton of back-and-forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alex:\n",
    "I totally understand, Jamie. I’ll send over some guides and set you up with a sandbox account to test things out. Let’s reconnect in a couple of weeks to go over any questions you might have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jamie:\n",
    "Sounds good, thanks, Alex. Looking forward to trying it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alex:\n",
    "Great! Thanks for your time, Jamie. I’ll follow up soon. Have a good one!\n",
