    "# Analyzing interviews\n",
    "This notebook provides sample [EDSL](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/) code for using a language model to analyze themes and other qualitative content in interviews. The task is designed as a survey about a set of interview transcripts that is answered by a language model, generating responses in the form of a summary dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "[EDSL is an open-source library](https://github.com/expectedparrot/edsl) for simulating surveys, experiments and other research with AI agents and large language models. \n",
    "Before running the code below, please ensure that you have [installed the EDSL library](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/installation.html) and either [activated remote inference](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/remote_inference.html) from your [Coop account](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/coop.html) or [stored API keys](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/api_keys.html) for the language models that you want to use with EDSL.
