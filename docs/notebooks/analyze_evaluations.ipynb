    "# Analyzing course evaluations\n",
    "This notebook provides sample [EDSL](https://pypi.org/project/edsl/) code for using a language model to analyze course evaluations. The analysis is designed as a survey of questions about a set of evaluations that we prompt an AI agent to answer, using a language model to generate the responses as a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "[EDSL is an open-source library](https://github.com/expectedparrot/edsl) for simulating surveys, experiments and other research with AI agents and large language models. \n",
    "Before running the code below, please ensure that you have [installed the EDSL library](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/installation.html) and either [activated remote inference](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/remote_inference.html) from your [Coop account](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/coop.html) or [stored API keys](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/api_keys.html) for the language models that you want to use with EDSL.

    "We start by creating questions about a set of course evaluations for an agent to answer. EDSL comes with a [variety of question types](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/questions.html) that we can choose from based on the form of the response that we want to get back from a model (multiple choice, linear scale, checkbox, free text, numerical, dictionary, etc.). We can use a `{{ placeholder }}` in the question texts to parameterize them with each evaluation. This allows us to create different \"scenarios\" of the questions that we can administer at once."
