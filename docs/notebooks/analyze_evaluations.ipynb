    "# Analyzing course evaluations\n",
    "This notebook provides sample [EDSL](https://pypi.org/project/edsl/) code for using a language model to analyze course evaluations. The analysis is designed as a survey of questions about the evaluations that we prompt an AI agent to answer, using a language model to generate the responses as a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "[EDSL is an open-source library](https://github.com/expectedparrot/edsl) for simulating surveys, experiments and other research with AI agents and large language models. \n",
    "Before running the code below, please ensure that you have [installed the EDSL library](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/installation.html) and either [activated remote inference](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/remote_inference.html) from your [Coop account](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/coop.html) or [stored API keys](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/api_keys.html) for the language models that you want to use with EDSL. Please also see our [documentation page](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/) for tips and tutorials on getting started using EDSL."

    "## Create questions\n",
    "We start by creating questions about a set of course evaluations for an agent to answer. EDSL comes with a [variety of question types](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/questions.html) that we can choose from based on the form of the response that we want to get back from a model (multiple choice, linear scale, checkbox, free text, etc.). We can use a `{{ placeholder }}` in the question texts to parameterize them with each evaluation. This allows us to create different \"scenarios\" of the questions that we can administer at once."

I also really appreciated the diversity of perspectives we explored in class, especially in terms of global economic policies.', \"I found the textbook to be overly complex for an introductory course. It often used jargon that hadn't been explained in lectures, which was confusing. Simpler reading materials or more explanatory lectures would make a big difference for newcomers to economics.\", 'The professor was knowledgeable and clearly passionate about economics, but I felt the course relied too heavily on tests rather than more creative forms of assessment. More varied assignments would make the course more accessible to students with different learning styles.', 'This class was a solid introduction to economics, though it leaned heavily on theoretical aspects. I would have liked more opportunities to discuss the real-world implications of economic theories, which I believe would enhance understanding and retention of the material.']}, {'answer.improvements_list': [['Adjust lecture pacing and incorporate interactive activities', 'Provide additional resources and summaries for readings'], ['Incorporate real-world applications and examples', 'Facilitate discussions and projects on current events'], [], ['Incorporate real-world applications and examples', 'Facilitate discussions and projects on current events', 'Include practical applications and problem-solving exercises'], ['Enhance feedback and provide detailed assignment critiques'], ['Increase variety and use of teaching methods and visual aids', 'Invite guest speakers and use real-world case studies'], [], ['Provide additional resources and summaries for readings', 'Select accessible and clear textbooks'], ['Incorporate diverse and project-based assessments'], ['Incorporate real-world applications and examples', 'Facilitate discussions and projects on current events', 'Include practical applications and problem-solving exercises']]}])"
