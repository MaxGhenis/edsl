    "# Using EDSL to sense check data\n",
    "This notebook provides example code for sense checking survey data using [EDSL](https://docs.expectedparrot.com), an open-source library for simulating surveys, experiments and market research with AI agents and large language models. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Contents\n",
    "Using a set of responses to a survey about online marketplaces as an example, we demonstrate EDSL methods for: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Evaluating survey questions (e.g., for clarity and improvements)\n",
    "2. Analyzing each respondent's set of answers (e.g., to summarize or identify sentiment, themes, etc.)\n",
    "3. Reviewing each answer individually (e.g., to evaluate its relevance or usefulness)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coop\n",
    "We also show how to post EDSL questions, surveys, results and notebooks (like this one) to [Coop: an integrated platform for creating and sharing LLM-based research](https://www.expectedparrot.com/explore). \n",
    "\n",
    "## How EDSL works\n",
    "EDSL is a flexible library that can be used to perform a broad variety of research tasks. A typical workflow consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Construct questions  \n",
    "* Add data to the questions (e.g., for data labeling tasks)\n",
    "* Use an AI agent to answer the questions\n",
    "* Select a language model to generate the answers\n",
    "* Analyze results in a formatted dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical setup\n",
    "Before running the code below please ensure that you have completed setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Install](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/installation.html) the EDSL library.\n",
    "* Create a [Coop account](https://www.expectedparrot.com/login) and activate [remote inference](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/remote_inference.html) OR store your own [API Keys](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/api_keys.html) for language models that you want to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our [Starter Tutorial](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/starter_tutorial.html) provides examples of EDSL basic components. "

This can lead to several issues:\\n\\n* **Difficult to analyze:**  Responses will be highly varied and qualitative, making it hard to quantify results or identify common themes easily.  It requires significant manual coding and interpretation, which is time-consuming and prone to subjective bias.\\n\\n* **Potential for irrelevant answers:** Respondents might focus on things outside the scope of the marketplace itself (e.g., \"I like online shopping in general\").\\n\\n* **Bias towards positive responses:** The question only asks for what people *like* most, neglecting negative aspects or areas for improvement.  A more balanced approach would include questions about dislikes or suggestions for improvement.\\n\\n* **Difficulty for respondents:**  Some users might struggle to articulate their most liked aspect concisely, leading to incomplete or rambling answers.\\n\\n\\nTo improve the question, consider:\\n\\n* **Using multiple-choice options:** Offer a pre-defined list of aspects (e.g., ease of use, product selection, customer service, price, etc.) allowing for quantitative analysis.\\n\\n* **Using a rating scale:**  Combine the multiple-choice options with a rating scale (e.g., 1-5 stars) for each aspect.\\n\\n* **Adding open-ended follow-up questions:** After the multiple-choice/rating scale section, include an optional open-ended question allowing respondents to elaborate on their choices.  This balances quantitative and qualitative data collection.\\n\\nIn short, while the question is understandable, its lack of structure makes it inefficient and less informative for data analysis.  A more structured approach is needed to gather useful insights.', 'The main problem is that the question is **too open-ended and lacks constraints**.  This can lead to several issues:\\n\\n* **Difficult to analyze:** Responses will vary wildly, making it hard to categorize and analyze the data effectively.  You\\'ll get a wide range of features, some highly specific and others very broad, making it difficult to identify trends or prioritize improvements.\\n\\n* **Bias towards highly specific requests:**  Instead of focusing on overarching needs, respondents might focus on niche features that only affect a small portion of the user base.\\n\\n* **Potential for irrelevant answers:** Some responses might be completely unrelated to improving the shopping experience (e.g., \"better customer service\" which is a broad category itself, not a specific feature).\\n\\n* **Difficulty in comparing responses:**  Comparing \"faster checkout\" with \"a better mobile app\" is difficult because they address different aspects of the shopping experience.\\n\\n\\nTo improve the question, consider:\\n\\n* **Providing a list of options:** Offer a multiple-choice question with pre-defined features, allowing for \"other\" as a free-text field for truly unique suggestions.\\n* **Focusing on specific aspects of the shopping experience:** Instead of a general question, ask about specific areas like checkout, search functionality, or product information.  For example: \"What could we improve about our checkout process to make it faster and easier?\"\\n* **Using rating scales:**  Combine the open-ended question with a rating scale for each feature to gauge the importance of different improvements.\\n\\n\\nIn short, while the question is understandable, its lack of structure makes it unsuitable for collecting meaningful and analyzable data.', 'The question \"Can you describe a recent experience where you were dissatisfied with our service?\" has a few potential problems:\\n\\n* **Leading Question:** It presupposes that the respondent *has* had a negative experience.  This can lead to biased responses, as people might feel pressured to provide a negative experience even if they don\\'t have one, or they might downplay positive experiences to fit the framing of the question.  A neutral question would be better.\\n\\n* **Ambiguous \"our service\":**  Depending on the context, \"our service\" might be unclear.  If the survey is for a large organization with many departments or services, the respondent might not know which aspect of the service the question refers to.  Being more specific is crucial.\\n\\n* **\"Recent\" is undefined:** What constitutes \"recent\"? A week? A month? A year?  Defining a timeframe would make the responses more consistent and comparable.\\n\\n* **Cognitive burden:** Asking for a full description can be demanding.  It might be more effective to break the question down into smaller, more manageable parts, perhaps starting with a rating scale of satisfaction and then only asking for a description if the rating is low.\\n\\n\\nIn short, the question is too broad and leading, making it less likely to yield reliable and insightful data.  A better approach would involve multiple, more specific and neutral questions.']}, {'answer.improved': ['Thinking about your recent experience with us, is there anything specific you would like to share?
