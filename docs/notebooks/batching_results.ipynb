    "# Batching results\n",
    "This notebook provides sample [EDSL](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/) code for combining survey [results](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/results.html) into a single `Results` object. This can be useful when you are running a survey with batches of [scenarios](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/scenarios.html), such as when completing a large-scale [data labeling](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/notebooks/data_labeling_example.html) task with chunks of data as inputs for the questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical setup\n",
    "Before running the code below, please ensure that you have [installed the EDSL library](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/installation.html) and either [activated remote inference](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/remote_inference.html) from your [Coop account](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/coop.html) or [stored API keys](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/api_keys.html) for the language models that you want to use with EDSL. Please also see our [documentation page](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/) for tips and tutorials on getting started using EDSL."
