    "# Creating question variants\n",
    "EDSL comes with a variety of features for efficiently generating different versions of questions in surveys. This notebook demonstrates methods for doing this with `Scenario` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a `Scenario`?\n",
    "A `Scenario` is a dictionary of one or more key/value pairs representing data or content to be added to questions; a `ScenarioList` is a list of `Scenario` objects. \n",
    "Scenario keys are used as question parameters that get replaced with the values when the scenarios are added to the questions, allowing you to create variants of questions efficiently.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from edsl import QuestionFreeText, ScenarioList, Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "q = QuestionFreeText(\n",
    "    question_name = \"favorite\",\n",
    "    question_text = \"What is your favorite {{ thing }}?\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "s = ScenarioList(\n",
    "    Scenario({\"thing\": t}) for t in [\"flower\", \"pizza topping\", \"chatbot\"]\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using scenarios\n",
    "Scenarios can be added to questions when constructing a survey or when running it.\n",
    "Functionally, the same question context is delivered to agents and models whether they are added during or after survey construction. \n",
    "The difference is how the information is arranged in the results that are generated by the models. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding scenarios at survey construction: `loop`\n",
    "Each question type (`QuestionMultipleChoice`, `QuestionFreeText`, etc.) has a `loop()` method that generates a copy of the question for each scenario in a `ScenarioList` that is passed to it, returning a list of the questions that are generated. \n",
    "The `loop()` method is used when survey questions are being constructed. \n",
    "The typical workflow is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Construct a (single) `Question` with one or more parameters\n",
    "* Construct a `ScenarioList`\n",
    "* Call the `loop()` method on the question and pass it the scenario list\n",
    "* Pass the list of the questions to a `Survey`\n",
    "\n",
    "From the example above this looks like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "from edsl import Survey\n",
    "\n",
    "questions = q.loop(s)\n",
    "survey = Survey(questions)\n",
    "results = survey.run()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When the survey is run, the results that are generated will include columns for each question and answer; there are no `scenario` columns in the results (unless scenarios are *also* added when the survey is run).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running a survey with scenarios: `by` \n",
    "Scenarios can also be passed to a question or survey at the time that it is run. \n",
    "This is done by calling the `by()` method on a survey, passing it the scenarios, and then calling the `run()` method.\n",
    "The typical workflow is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Construct a question (or survey of multiple questions) with one or more parameters\n",
    "* Construct scenarios\n",
    "* Call the `by()` method on the question or survey and pass it the scenarios\n",
    "* Call the `run()` method to administer the question or survey\n",
    "\n",
    "From the example above this looks like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "results = q.by(s).run()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(If any agents or models have been created and specified, they would also be added in separated `by()` calls. \n",
    "See details on [designing agents](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/agents.html) and [selecting language models](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/language_models.html).)"
