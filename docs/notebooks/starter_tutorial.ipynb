    "# Starter Tutorial\n",
    "This tutorial provides example code for basic features of [EDSL, an open-source Python library](https://pypi.org/project/edsl/) for simulating surveys, experiments and other research using AI agents and large language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the steps below we show how to construct and run a simple question in EDSL, and then how to design more complex surveys with AI agents and different language models.\n",
    "We also demonstrate methods for applying logic and rules to surveys, piping answers and adding data to questions, and analyzing survey results as datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical setup\n",
    "Before running the code below, please ensure that you have completed technical steps for using EDSL:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Download the EDSL package.** See [installation](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/installation.html) instructions and options.\n",
    "* *Optional:* **Create a Coop account.** [Coop](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/coop.html) is a platform for creating, storing and sharing AI-based research. [Create an account](https://www.expectedparrot.com/login) to share your EDSL surveys, results, notebooks and other work, and access special features such as hybrid human-AI surveys.\n",
    "* **Choose how to manage API keys for language models.** Decide whether you want to [manage your own API keys](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/api_keys.html) for language models or activate [remote inference](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/remote_inference.html) to use your Expected Parrot API key to securely access all available models at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter any issues or have questions, please email us at info@expectedparrot.com or post a question at our [Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/mxAYkjfy9m)."

    "* In the former case, the `loop` method is used to create a list of versions of a question with the scenarios already added to it; when the questions are passed to a survey and it is run, the results include columns for each individual question; there is no `scenario` column and a single row for each agent's answers to all the questions.\n",

My favorite place for running is a secluded forest trail where the canopy of trees creates a natural gallery of light and shadow, inspiring each stride.  My favorite place for relaxing is a quiet art studio filled with natural light, where I can paint and let my creativity flow freely.\n",
