    "# Survey features checklist\n",
    "This notebook provides a checklist of key features of EDSL for use in reviewing the logic and contents of a survey and ensuring that it will run as you intend it to.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Support\n",
    "Please reach out to us with any questions or issues! \n",
    "Send an email to **info@expectedparrot.com** or post a message at [Discord]().\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding how EDSL works\n",
    "At its core, EDSL is built on the concept of a [`Question`](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/questions.html) being answered by an AI [`Agent`](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/agents.html), which uses a large language [`Model`](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/language_models.html) to generate a response, returning it as a formatted [`Result`](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/results.html). \n",
    "A typical workflow consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Construct questions of different types (multiple choice, free text, etc.) and combine them in a survey. Learn about [question types](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/questions.html).\n",
    "2. *Optional:* Add data or content to your questions (from CSVs, PDFs, docs, images, etc.). Learn about [scenarios](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/scenarios.html).\n",
    "3. *Optional:* Add rules or logic to specify how questions should be presented (e.g., skip/stop rules, or including context of other questions). Learn about [survey rules](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/surveys.html).\n",
    "4. *Optional:* Design or import personas for AI agents to answer the questions. Learn about [agents](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/agents.html).\n",
    "5. Select language models to generate responses. EDSL works with hundreds of popular [models](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/language_models.html) to choose from.\n",
    "6. Run the survey and get a formatted dataset of results. Use built-in methods for analyzing them.\n",
    "7. *Optional:* Store and share your work at the [Coop](https://www.expectedparrot.com/content/explore): a platform for AI research that is fully integrated with EDSL. Learn more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key features\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Skip/stop rules:** Is logic for skipping questions correctly expressed in the rules?\n",
    "* **Question memory:** Does any `question_text` depend on information in or responses to other questions in the survey, either impliedly or expressly?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common errors\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In reviewing your survey, there may be questions that require information from other questions in the survey, either in whole or in part.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Incomplete question options** \n",
    "* Use `QuestionYesNo` when you only want to allow \"Yes\" or \"No\" responses.\n",
    "* Use `QuestionMultipleChoice` when you want a model to select one option only.\n",
    "* Use `QuestionCheckBox` when you want to allow a model to make multiple (or no) selections, or specify a number of selections.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wrong question type**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Missing context**\n",
    "* The model does not have enough information to answer the question. Context of another question is needed, e.g., the response, or any content that has been added to a prior question for the model to evaluate. Learn about [piping]() questions and adding [question memory]().\n",
    "* A question text says multiple options may be selected, but the question type is multiple choice.\n",
    "* The question options c\n",

    "## Tools for auto-importing survey data\n",
    "EDSL also provides features for importing data to use in surveys:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conjure\n",
    "The `Conjure` module allows you to impoort a file of survey data (SPSS, CSV) and automatically generate EDSL objects based on it:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A `Survey` consisting of the original survey questions.\n",
    "* An `AgentList` of agents representing the original respondents, with traits for their original responses.\n",
    "* A `Results` dataset of the original responses that you can analyze with EDSL's built-in methods for analyzing any survey responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Learn more]().\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools for generating question scenarios\n",
    "EDSL provides many methods for automatically formatting data or content to be used with a survey.\n",
    "[Learn more]() about creating and using `Scenario` and `ScenarioList` objects for texts, docs, PDFs, images, CSVs, tables and other data types that you want to add to survey questions or store with survey results as metadata. "
