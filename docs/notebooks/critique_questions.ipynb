    "# Research: Critiquing survey questions\n",
    "This notebook shows some ways of using EDSL to critique and improve survey questions. We do this by parameterizing a series of free text questions prompting an AI agent to provide feedback and criticism a survey question. We then ask the agent to provide a better version of the survey question, with and without the agent's responses to the prompts for feedback and criticism. We also compare results from different personas assigned to the agents and results using different LLMs."
