    "# Research: Critiquing survey questions\n",
    "This notebook shows some ways of using EDSL to critique and improve survey questions. We do this by parameterizing a series of free text questions prompting an AI agent to provide feedback and criticism a survey question. We then ask the agent to provide a better version of the survey question, with and without the agent's responses to the prompts for feedback and criticism. We also compare results from different personas assigned to the agents and results using different LLMs."

Guarantee anonymity: Assure respondents that their individual responses will be confidential and that results will only be reported in aggregate form. 2. Emphasize the importance of accurate data: Explain how truthful responses can lead to better decision-making or more relevant findings that can benefit the respondent's community or demographic. 3. Provide a range of income brackets: Instead of asking for an exact figure, offer categories of income ranges for respondents to select from, which might reduce the discomfort associated with disclosing exact amounts. 4. Include a 'Prefer not to say' option: This allows respondents who are uncomfortable sharing their income to still participate in the survey without providing false information. 5. Ensure the survey is conducted by a trusted organization: Respondents are more likely to be truthful if they trust the organization conducting the survey. 6. Use indirect questioning: For example, ask about spending habits or lifestyle indicators that can be correlated with income levels instead of asking about income directly. 7. Normalize the question: Preface the income question with statements that indicate it is a common question to ask and that many others have already answered honestly.</td>\n",
