    "# Concept induction\n",
    "This notebook offers sample [EDSL](https://docs.expectedparrot.com) code for using language models to identify concepts in unstructured texts, then generate criteria for the concepts, and then apply the criteria to evaluate the texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea is inspired by the recent paper: [Concept Induction: Analyzing Unstructured Text with High-Level Concepts Using LLooM](https://hci.stanford.edu/publications/2024/Lam_LLooM_CHI24.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical setup\n",
    "Before running the code below, please ensure that you have [installed the EDSL library](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/installation.html) and either [activated remote inference](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/remote_inference.html) from your [Coop account](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/coop.html) or [stored API keys](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/api_keys.html) for the language models that you want to use with EDSL.
