    "This notebook explores ways of specifying \"contexts\" in which an EDSL survey is \"administered\" to agents in order to investigate potential impacts to simulated responses. We show how to do this in three different ways by modifying  our `Question` texts and `Agent` traits in order to reflect various hypothetical real world contexts.\n",
