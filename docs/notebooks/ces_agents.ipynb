    "# Creating AI agents for survey respondents\n",
    "This notebook provides code for creating AI agents based on responses to the [**CES 2022 Pre-Election Questionnaire**](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi%3A10.7910/DVN/PR4L8P) using [EDSL](https://github.com/expectedparrot/edsl), an open-source Python library for simulating social science research with large language models. EDSL is developed by [Expected Parrot](https://www.expectedparrot.com), a start-up building tools for AI-powered research.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sections\n",
    "The sections below demonstrate how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import survey data** into EDSL using `Conjure`.\n",
    "2. **Select questions and responses** (optionally subset the original data).\n",
    "3. **Use a language model to suggest questions**, e.g., based on relevance to a given topic.\n",
    "4. **Create an `AgentList` panel based on survey responses.**\n",
    "5. **Conduct new surveys with agents**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Companion notebooks\n",
    "This notebook is designed to be used with 2 companion notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Using EDSL for AI polling]() demonstrates basic methods for designing AI agents and conducting surveys with them.\n",
    "* [Working with CES data in EDSL]() provides code for working with CES datasets in EDSL.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reference & contact\n",
    "Documentation for the EDSL package is available at [https://docs/expectedparrot.com](https://docs/expectedparrot.com).\n",
    "You can also find example code, tutorials and notebooks for a variety of use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please let us know if you have any questions or encounter issues working with this data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/mxAYkjfy9m\n",
    "* Email: info@expectedparrot.com\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical setup\n",
    "EDSL is compatible with Python 3.9-3.12.\n",
    "\n",
    "See instructions on [installing the EDSL library](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/installation.html) and [storing API keys](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/api_keys.html) for the language models that you want to use.\n",
    "In examples below where no model is specified, EDSL will use GPT 4 by default (an API key for OpenAI is required).\n",
    "We also show how to use different models."
