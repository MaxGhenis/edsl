We finally went to that little coastal town in Maine we've been talking about for years –  Ogunquit!  It was just my husband, Mark, and I, a much-needed getaway. We rented this adorable little cottage, right near Marginal Way, you know, that stunning cliff walk?  It was just breathtaking, all those rocky cliffs and the ocean crashing against them. We spent hours just walking along there, taking pictures, and just breathing in the fresh sea air.  It was so peaceful.  We even saw some seals!  Mark, bless his heart, even tried to get a picture of them, but they were much too quick for him.  We ate lobster rolls practically every day – I know, I know, it's touristy, but they were *so* good!  And the sunsets?  Don't even get me started.  Every single evening was like a painting. We'd sit on our porch, sipping wine, and just watch the colors change.  It was truly restorative. I felt so relaxed and recharged when we got back.  It was exactly what we needed.  We're already planning our next trip!  Maybe Nantucket next time?</td>\n",

We didn't do anything fancy; mostly just hiked,  read by the lake, and ate way too much ice cream.  It was simple, quiet... and exactly what the doctor ordered.  Honestly, I barely remember the details, it was so relaxing.  I'm ready for the next question.</td>\n",

My most recent vacation was absolutely amazing.  We finally went to that little coastal town in Maine we've been talking about for years –  Ogunquit!  It was just my husband, Mark, and I, a much-needed getaway. We rented this adorable little cottage, right near Marginal Way, you know, that stunning cliff walk?  It was just breathtaking, all those rocky cliffs and the ocean crashing against them. We spent hours just walking along there, taking pictures, and just breathing in the fresh sea air.  It was so peaceful.  We even saw some seals!  Mark, bless his heart, even tried to get a picture of them, but they were much too quick for him.  We ate lobster rolls practically every day – I know, I know, it's touristy, but they were *so* good!  And the sunsets?  Don't even get me started.  Every single evening was like a painting. We'd sit on our porch, sipping wine, and just watch the colors change.  It was truly restorative. I felt so relaxed and recharged when we got back.  It was exactly what we needed.  We're already planning our next trip!  Maybe Nantucket next time?\", \"Oh, honey, my most recent vacation?  Let's just say it was... *necessary*.  It was a long weekend up in the Berkshires, just me and my oldest, Chloe.  Needed a break, you know?  Work's been brutal, and Chloe's been stressed about college apps – the whole shebang.  We didn't do anything fancy; mostly just hiked,  read by the lake, and ate way too much ice cream.  It was simple, quiet... and exactly what the doctor ordered.  Honestly, I barely remember the details, it was so relaxing.  I'm ready for the next question.\", 'We spent a long weekend in Vermont last October.  The foliage was spectacular.
