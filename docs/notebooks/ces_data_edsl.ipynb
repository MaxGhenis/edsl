    "# Working with CES data in EDSL\n",
    "This notebook provides code for reconstructing the [**CES 2022 Pre-election Questionnaire**](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi%3A10.7910/DVN/PR4L8P) in EDSL.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We format the questions as EDSL `Question` objects of various types: `QuestionYesNo`, `QuestionMultipleChoice`, `QuestionCheckBox`, `QuestionNumerical`, `QuestionFreeText`.\n",
    "2. We show how to combine the questions in a `Survey` to administer them to agents at once. This can also be done with any subset of the questions.\n",
    "3. We create dictionaries of the questions and answer codebook for convenience in working with this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Companion notebooks\n",
    "This notebook is designed to be used with 2 companion notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Using EDSL for AI polling](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/notebooks/edsl_polling.html) demonstrates basic methods for designing AI agents and conducting surveys with them.\n",
    "* [Creating agents for survey respondents](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/notebooks/ces_agents.html) demonstrates how to import the [dataset of responses to the 2022 CES Pre-Election Questionnaire](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?fileId=10140882&version=4.0) into EDSL and use them to construct agents representing the respondents. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Reference & contact\n",
    "Documentation for the EDSL package is available at [https://docs/expectedparrot.com](https://docs/expectedparrot.com).\n",
    "You can also find example code, tutorials and notebooks for a variety of use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please let us know if you have any questions or encounter issues working with this data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/mxAYkjfy9m\n",
    "* Email: info@expectedparrot.com\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical setup\n",
    "EDSL is compatible with Python 3.9-3.12.\n",
    "\n",
    "See instructions on [installing the EDSL library](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/installation.html) and [storing API keys](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/api_keys.html) for the language models that you want to use.\n",
    "In examples below where no model is specified, EDSL will use GPT 4 by default (an API key for OpenAI is required).\n",
    "We also show how to use different models."

    "## Formatting questions in EDSL\n",
    "The code below formats each of the questions in the [CES 2022 Pre-election Questionnaire](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?fileId=6987030&version=4.0) as an EDSL `Question` object of the relevant type.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\n",
    "* Each original \"grid\" question is formatted as independent multiple choice questions.\n",
    "* Some questions require parameters to be added (e.g., `$CurrentGovName`). This can be done with `Scenario` objects which we demonstrate how to do at the end of this notebook."
