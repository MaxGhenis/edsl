Notebooks
=========

The `Notebook` object allows you to share your notebooks and scripts (*.ipynb* and *.py* files) by uploading them to Coop.
You can also view and pull notebooks that other users have uploaded and shared publicly or privately with you.

Examples of methods below are also viewable in `this notebook at the Coop <https://www.expectedparrot.com/content/ffa113f4-4f2a-407b-8fc6-27bdf5e69d2f>`_.


Creating a `Notebook` object
----------------------------

There are three ways to create a `Notebook` object:


1. From a *.ipynb* file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pass the path to your *.ipynb* file to the constructor (*note:* you must include `path` as a keyword argument):

.. code-block:: python

    from edsl import Notebook

    notebook = Notebook(path="your_notebook.ipynb") # replace with your file path


2. From a *.py* script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Call the `from_script()` method on the constructor and pass it the path to your *.py* script:

.. code-block:: python

    from edsl import Notebook

    notebook = Notebook.from_script("your_script.py") # replace with your script path


3. From data
^^^^^^^^^^^^

For this method, your data must be a Python `dict` that conforms to the official Jupyter notebook format. 
Learn more about the format `here <https://nbformat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format_description.html>`_.

.. code-block:: python

    from edsl import Notebook

    data = {
        "metadata": dict(),
        "nbformat": 4,
        "nbformat_minor": 4,
        "cells": [
            {
                "cell_type": "markdown",
                "metadata": dict(),
                "source": "# Test notebook",
            },
        ],
    }

    notebook = Notebook(data=data)


4. From self
^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a `Notebook` for a notebook that you are currently working in:

.. code-block:: python

    from edsl import Notebook

    # Do not pass any arguments to the constructor
    notebook = Notebook()


.. warning::

    For now, this method only works if you are using the VS Code IDE. 



Uploading a notebook to Coop
----------------------------

A notebook can be posted to Coop in the same ways as other EDSL objects: by calling the `push()` method on the object or calling the `create` method on a `Coop` object and passing it the notebook.

Here we create a `Notebook` object and use the `push()` method to post it to Coop:

.. code-block:: python

    from edsl import Notebook

    notebook = Notebook(path="demo_notebook.ipynb")

    notebook.push()


This will return a message with information about the object that was posted, and you will be able to view your notebook at the Coop: `Content  <https://www.expectedparrot.com/home/content>`_:

.. code-block:: text

    {'description': None,
    'object_type': 'notebook',
    'url': 'https://www.expectedparrot.com/content/fc671612-4144-4da3-a7b5-23587cc5a788',
    'uuid': 'fc671612-4144-4da3-a7b5-23587cc5a788',
    'version': '0.1.36.dev1',
    'visibility': 'unlisted'}


We can see that the notebook has at an unlisted (non-searchable) URL with no description.
We can edit the description and the visibility status directly at the Coop or by passing the arguments to the `push()` method:

.. code-block:: python

    from edsl import Notebook

    notebook = Notebook(path="demo_notebook.ipynb")

    notebook.push(description="This is a demo notebook", visibility="public") # add description and make it public


We can see that the notebook has been reposted publicly with a description:

.. code-block:: text

    {'description': 'This is a demo notebook',
    'object_type': 'notebook',
    'url': 'https://www.expectedparrot.com/content/1742e39d-9f6d-4997-bfea-eda99120cf06',
    'uuid': '1742e39d-9f6d-4997-bfea-eda99120cf06',
    'version': '0.1.36.dev1',
    'visibility': 'public'}


Here we alternatively use the `Coop` client object to post the notebook:

.. code-block:: python

    from edsl import Coop, Notebook

    coop = Coop()

    notebook = Notebook(path="demo_notebook.ipynb")

    coop.create(notebook, description="This is a demo notebook", visibility="public")


This will return a message with information about the object that was posted, and you will be able to view your notebook at the Coop: `Content  <https://www.expectedparrot.com/home/content>`_.

.. code-block:: text

    {'description': 'This is a demo notebook',
    'object_type': 'notebook',
    'url': 'https://www.expectedparrot.com/content/ffa113f4-4f2a-407b-8fc6-27bdf5e69d2f',
    'uuid': 'ffa113f4-4f2a-407b-8fc6-27bdf5e69d2f',
    'version': '0.1.35',
    'visibility': 'public'}


Updating a notebook on Coop
---------------------------

A notebook can be updated on Coop in the same ways as other EDSL objects: by calling the `patch()` method on the object or calling the `update` method on a `Coop` object and passing it the parameters to be modified.

Here we update the `description` of a notebook that we have already posted:

.. code-block:: python

    from edsl import Notebook

    notebook = Notebook.pull("ffa113f4-4f2a-407b-8fc6-27bdf5e69d2f")

    notebook.patch(
        uuid = "ffa113f4-4f2a-407b-8fc6-27bdf5e69d2f", 
        description = "This is an updated demo notebook"
        )


Here we alternatively use the `Coop` client object:

.. code-block:: python

    from edsl import Coop

    c = Coop()  

    c.patch(
        uuid="ffa113f4-4f2a-407b-8fc6-27bdf5e69d2f",
        description = "This is an updated demo notebook"
        )  


Here we update the contents of the notebook itself by passing the `value` argument:

.. code-block:: python

    notebook = Notebook(path="demo_notebook.ipynb") # resaving the notebook

    notebook.patch(
        uuid = "ffa113f4-4f2a-407b-8fc6-27bdf5e69d2f", 
        value = notebook
        )


Saving a Coop notebook to file
------------------------------

You can access notebooks that other users have posted publicly at the Coop `Content <https://www.expectedparrot.com/content>`_ page.

Notebooks can be copied and downloaded the same way as other EDSL objects: by calling the `pull()` method on the `Notebook` constructor or the `get` method on a `Coop` client object and passing the notebook's `uuid`.
You can also use the `to_file()` method to save the notebook to a file:

.. code-block:: python

    from edsl import Notebook

    notebook = Notebook.pull("ffa113f4-4f2a-407b-8fc6-27bdf5e69d2f")

    notebook.to_file("new_demo_notebook.ipynb")


This allows you to edit and run the notebook on your local machine.


Deleting a notebook from Coop
-----------------------------

A notebook can be deleted from Coop in the same ways as other EDSL objects: by calling the `delete()` method on the constructor and passing it the `uuid` of the notebook to be deleted.
You can also delete a notebook manually from your Coop account.

Here we delete a notebook using the `Notebook` object:

.. code-block:: python

    from edsl import Notebook

    Notebook.delete(uuid = "ffa113f4-4f2a-407b-8fc6-27bdf5e69d2f")
