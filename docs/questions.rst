Questions
=========

.. This module contains the Question class, which is the base class for all questions in EDSL.

EDSL includes templates for many common question types, including multiple choice, checkbox, free text, numerical, linear scale, Likert scale and others.
Each question type inherits from the `Question` class and implements its own methods for validating answers and responses from language models.

Every question type requires a question name and question text. 
The `question_name` is a unique Pythonic identifier for a question (e.g., "favorite_color" but not "favorite color").
The `question_text` is the text of the question itself written as a string (e.g., "What is your favorite color?").

Question types other than free text require certain additional fields.
For example, multiple choice, checkbox, linear scale, rank, top k and budget questions all require a `question_options` list of available answer options.
See examples of each type below for details on formatting.


Constructing a question
-----------------------
Select and import a question type based on the desired output. 
For example, to return a single option selected from a given list we can create a multiple choice question:

.. code-block:: python

   from edsl import QuestionMultipleChoice

Construct a question in the question type template:

.. code-block:: python

   q = QuestionMultipleChoice(
      question_name = "favorite_primary_color",
      question_text = "Which is your favorite primary color?",
      question_options = ["Red", "Yellow", "Blue"] # must be a list of strings
   )

You can also use the `example()` method to show an example of any question type:

.. code-block:: python

   QuestionMultipleChoice.example()


Parameterizing a question
-------------------------
A question can be constructed to take one or more parameters that are replaced with specific values when the question is run.
This allows us to create multiple versions of a question that can be administered all at once or according to specified rules (e.g., skip or stop logic).

*Key steps*:

* Create a question text that takes a parameter in double braces:

.. code-block:: python

   from edsl.questions import QuestionFreeText

   q = QuestionFreeText(
      question_name = "favorite_item",
      question_text = "What is your favorite {{ item }}?",
   )

* Create a dictionary for the value that will replace the parameter and store it in a `Scenario` object:

.. code-block:: python

   scenario = Scenario({"item": "color"})

If multiple values will be used, create a list of `Scenario` objects:

.. code-block:: python

   scenarios = [Scenario({"item": item}) for item in ["color", "food"]]



Simulating a response 
---------------------
We generate a response to a question by delivering it to a language model.
In the simplest case, we can administer a question to the default LLM (GPT 4) by appending the `run()` method directly to the question:

.. code-block:: python

   results = q.run()

This generates a `Results` object that contains the response to the question, and information about the model used.


Combining questions into surveys 
--------------------------------
To administer questions together, we pass them as a list to a `Survey` object:

.. code-block:: python 

   from edsl import Survey 

   q1 = ...
   q2 = ...
   q3 = ...

   survey = Survey(questions = [q1, q2, q3])

We call the `run` method on a survey to generate responses to all of the questions at once:

.. code-block:: python

   results = survey.run()

To learn more about constructing surveys with conditional logic, see the :ref:`surveys` section.



Specifying agents and models
----------------------------
We can optionally specify agent traits.
Agent traits and language models can be specified by creating `Agent` and `Model` objects and assigning them to a survey (or single question) with the `by` method when running it.
For example, if we want to specify that our survey be answered by an AI agent that is a student we create an `Agent` object and pass it the desired traits:

.. code-block:: python

   from edsl import Agent

   agent = Agent(traits = {"persona": "You are a student."})

   results = survey.by(agent).run()

To specify a different language model for the survey, we can first check the available models:

.. code-block:: python

   from edsl import Model

   Model.available()

This will return a list of models to choose from:

.. code-block:: python

   ['gpt-3.5-turbo',
   'gpt-4-1106-preview',
   'gemini_pro',
   'llama-2-13b-chat-hf',
   'llama-2-70b-chat-hf',
   'mixtral-8x7B-instruct-v0.1']

We can create a `Model` object to use when running the survey:

.. code-block:: python

   model = Model('llama-2-70b-chat-hf') 


Simulating a response
---------------------
Responses are generated by calling the `run` method on a question or survey.
In the simplest case, we can adminster a single question to the default LLM (GPT 4) by appending the `run()` method directly to the `Question` object.
This will generate a `Results` object containing the response to the question:

.. code-block:: python 

   from edsl import QuestionMultipleChoice
   
   q = QuestionMultipleChoice(
      question_name = "favorite_primary_color",
      question_text = "Which is your favorite primary color?",
      question_options = ["Red", "Yellow", "Blue"] # must be a list of strings
   )

   results = q.run()


If we have multiple questions, we can combine them in a `Survey` object and call the `run` method on it instead:

.. code-block:: python
    
   q1 = ...
   q2 = ...
   q3 = ...

   from edsl import Survey

   survey = Survey(questions = [q1, q2, q3])

   results = survey.run()


If scenarios, agents and/or models have been specified, they are added to the question with the `by()` method at the time that it is run:

.. code-block:: python 

   results = q.by(scenarios).by(agents).by(models).run()

Same by method ...

*************

The `run` method can also be called directly on a `Survey` object:

.. code-block:: python 

   results = survey.by(scenarios).by(agents).by(models).run()


The results will include a `Result` object for each response to the survey.
If scenarios and multiple agents and models have been specified, a `Result` is generated for each combination of them.
    


Inspecting results 
------------------
The `run` method returns a `Results` object which is a list of individual `Result` objects representing each response to the survey.
Results can be printed, saved, analyzed and visualized in a variety of built-in methods.

See examples of results and details about these methods in the :ref:`results` section.



   results = survey.by(agent).by(model).run()

If multiple agents or models are desired, they can be added together as a list in the same `by` method:

.. code-block:: python

   results = survey.by([agent1, agent2]).by([model1, model2]).run()
