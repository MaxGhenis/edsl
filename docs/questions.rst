Questions
=========

.. This module contains the Question class, which is the base class for all questions in EDSL.

EDSL includes templates for many common question types, including multiple choice, checkbox, free text, numerical, linear scale, Likert scale and others.
The `Question` class has subclasses for each of these types (`QuestionMultipleChoice`, `QuestionFreeText`, etc.) which have methods for validating answers and responses from language models.


Question type templates 
-----------------------
Each question type requires a `question_name` and `question_text`. 
The `question_name` is a unique Pythonic identifier for a question (e.g., "favorite_color" but not "favorite color").
The `question_text` is the text of the question itself written as a string (e.g., "What is your favorite color?").

Individual question types other than free text also require certain additional fields.
For example, multiple choice, checkbox, linear scale, rank, top k and budget questions all require a `question_options` list of available answer options.
See examples below for details on required fields and formatting for each type.


Constructing a question
-----------------------
To construct a question, we start by importing the appropriate question type for the desired result. 
For example, if we want the response to be a single option selected from a given list we can create a multiple choice question:

.. code-block:: python

   from edsl import QuestionMultipleChoice

Next we format a question in the question type template. 
A multiple choice question requires a question name, question text and list of question options:

.. code-block:: python

   q = QuestionMultipleChoice(
      question_name = "favorite_primary_color",
      question_text = "Which is your favorite primary color?",
      question_options = ["red", "yellow", "blue"] 
   )

Details and examples of each question type can be found at the bottom of this page.


Creating a survey
-----------------
We can combine questions into a survey by passing a list of questions to a `Survey` object:

.. code-block:: python 

   from edsl import Survey 

   q1 = ...
   q2 = ...
   q3 = ...

   survey = Survey(questions = [q1, q2, q3])

This allows us to administer multiple questions at once, either asynchronously (by default) or according to specified logic (e.g., skip or stop rules).
To learn more about designing surveys with conditional logic, please see the :ref:`surveys` section.


Simulating a response 
---------------------
We generate a response to a question by delivering it to a language model.
This is done by calling the `run` method for the question:

.. code-block:: python

   results = q.run()

This will generate a `Results` object that contains a single `Result` representing the response to the question and information about the model used.
If the model to be used has not been specified (as in the above example), the `run` method delivers the question to the default LLM (GPT 4).
We can inspect the response and model used by calling the `select` and `print` methods on the components of the results that we want to display.
For example, we can print just the `answer` to the question:

.. code-block:: python 

   results.select("answer.favorite_primary_color").print()

Output:

.. code-block::

   blue

Or to inspect the model:

.. code-block:: python 

   results.select("model").print()

Output: 

.. code-block::

   gpt-4-1106-preview

If questions have been combined in a survey, the `run` method is called directly on the survey instead:

.. code-block:: python

   results = survey.run()

For a survey, each `Result` represents a response for the set of survey questions. 
To learn more about analyzing results, please see the :ref:`results` section.


Parameterizing a question
-------------------------
A question can also be constructed to take one or more parameters that are replaced with specified values when the question is run.
This allows us to easily create and administer multiple versions of a question at once.

*Key steps*:

Create a question text that takes a parameter in double braces:

.. code-block:: python

   from edsl.questions import QuestionFreeText

   q = QuestionFreeText(
      question_name = "favorite_item",
      question_text = "What is your favorite {{ item }}?",
   )

Create a dictionary for each value that will replace the parameter and store them in `Scenario` objects:

.. code-block:: python

   from edsl import Scenario 

   scenarios = [Scenario({"item": item}) for item in ["color", "food"]]

Pass the scenario or scenarios to the question with the `by` method when the question is run. 
If multiple scenarios are to be used, they are passed as a list:

.. code-block:: python 

   results = q.by(scenarios).run()

The `Results` that are generated will include an individual `Result` for each version of the question that was answered.
Scenarios can also be passed to a survey of questions in the same way:

.. code-block:: python 

   results = survey.by(scenarios).run()

This will generate `Results` where each `Result` includes responses for all the scenarios of each question in the survey.
To learn more about using scenarios, please see the :ref:`Scenarios` section.


Designing AI agents 
-------------------
A key feature of EDSL is the ability to design AI agents with personas and other traits for language models to use in responding to questions.
The use of agents allows us to simulate survey results for target audiences at scale.
This is done by creating `Agent` objects with dictionaries of desired traits and adding them to questions when they are run.
For example, if we want a question answered by an AI agent representing a student we can create an `Agent` object with a relevant persona and attributes:

.. code-block:: python

   from edsl import Agent

   agent = Agent(traits = {
      "persona": "You are a student...", # can be an extended text
      "age": 20, # individual trait values can be useful for analysis
      "current_grade": "college sophomore"
      })


To generate a response for the agent, we pass it to the `by` method when we run the question:

.. code-block:: python 

   results = q.by(agent).run()

If we have multiple agents, we pass them as a list:

.. code-block:: python 

   results = q.by(agents).run()

The `Results` will contain a `Result` for each agent that answered the question.
To learn more about designing agents, please see the :ref:`agents` section.


Specifying language models
--------------------------
In the above examples we did not specify a language model for the question or survey, so the default model (GPT 4) was used.
Similar to the way that we optionally passed scenarios to a question and added AI agents, we can also use the `by` method to specify one or more LLMs to use in generating results.
This is done by creating `Model` objects for desired models and optionally specifying model parameters, such as temperature.

To check available models:

.. code-block:: python

   from edsl import Model

   Model.available()

This will return a list of names of models that we can choose from:

.. code-block:: python

We can also check the models for which we have already added API keys:

.. code-block:: python 

   Model.check_models()

(See instructions on storing :ref:`api_keys` for the models that you want to use in your `.env` file.)

To specify models for a survey we first create `Model` objects:

.. code-block:: python

   models = [Model(model) for model in ['claude-3-opus-20240229', 'llama-2-70b-chat-hf']]

Then we add them to a question or survey with the `by` method when running it:

.. code-block:: python 

   results = q.by(models).run()

If scenarios and/or agents are also specified, each component is added in its own `by` call, chained together in any order, with the `run` method appended last:

.. code-block:: python 

   results = q.by(scenarios).by(agents).by(models).run()

Note that multiple scenarios, agents and models are always passed as lists in the same `by` call.
