Expected Parrot: Tools for AI-Powered Research
==============================================

Welcome to the documentation for the *Expected Parrot Domain-Specific Language* (EDSL), a Python package for conducting research with AI agents and large language models.
This guide also highlights key features and integrated applications:

* **Access to hundreds of models:** A single API key lets you conduct research with many popular models at once. `Learn more <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/remote_inference.html>`_.
* **Collaboration made easy:** Use `Coop <https://www.expectedparrot.com/content/explore>`_ to create, store, and share your research projects seamlessly.
* **Data integrations:** Easily import and analyze data from various sources. `Learn more <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/scenarios.html>`_.
* **Hybrid human-AI surveys:** Launch surveys and collect responses from both humans and AI agents. `Learn more <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/survey_builder.html>`_.
* **Built-in analysis tools:** Analyze survey results with EDSL's built-in methods. `Learn more <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/results.html>`_.

Use cases 
---------

EDSL and its integrated applications are designed to simplify survey creation, experiment execution, and response analysisâ€”whether from humans or AI. 
Common use cases include:

| **Data labeling and cleaning** 
| Design tasks that involve labeling or cleaning data through questionsa, and then use language models to generate responses in formatted datasets. See `examples <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/notebooks/data_labeling_example.html>`_.

| **Market research** 
| Administer surveys to gather insights on consumer preferences, behaviors, and trends. Simulate customer personas with AI agents and analyze their responses. See `examples <file:///Users/a16174/edsl/.temp/docs/notebooks/yoga_studio_name_survey.html>`_.

| **User experience research** 
| Design surveys to assess user satisfaction, usability, and engagement. Use AI agents to simulate user profiles and analyze their feedback on products or services. See `examples <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/notebooks/nps_survey.html>`_.

| **Integrate human and AI data**
| Combine human responses with AI-generated responses to create richer datasets. See `examples <file:///Users/a16174/edsl/.temp/docs/notebooks/import_agents.html>`_.

| **Analyze survey data**
| Import survey data from various sources (SPSS, CSV), analyze it using EDSL's built-in tools. Simulate follow-up surveys and interviews using AI agents. See `examples <https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/conjure.html>`_.

| **Social science research**
| Design surveys to explore hypotheses and gather qualitative or quantitative data using AI agents.

Getting started 
---------------

| **1. Install EDSL**
| Download and install the EDSL package. :ref:`installation` instructions.

| **2. Create a Coop account**
| `Sign up <https://www.expectedparrot.com/login>`_ for an account to store and share your research projects.

| **3. Choose your model access methods**
| You can either access language models remotely through the Expected Parrot server or use your own API keys to access models locally. 

| ***For remote access to all available models:***
| Activate :ref:`remote_inference` via your Coop account and store your Expected Parrot API key.

| ***For local access to specific models:***
| Store your own :ref:`api_keys` for the language models that you wish to use.

| **4. Explore examples**
| Get started with our :ref:`starter_tutorial` and explore additional guides and notebooks.
