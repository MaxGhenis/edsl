Installation
------------

Check for the latest version of edsl on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/edsl/

View the source code on GitHub: https://github.com/expectedparrot/edsl/

Installing the latest version:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install edsl

Updating your version:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install --upgrade edsl

API keys
--------

You will be prompted to provide API keys when you first access the package. You can skip this step by pressing return/enter. 
API keys are not required to construct surveys using edsl; however, you will need an API key in order to simulate responses using LLMs.

Note: The edsl API is coming soon! It will allow you to access all of the available LLMs with a single key managed by Expected Parrot.
