What is it?
-----------

The Coop is a platform for storing, sharing and accessing research in EDSL.


How does it work?
-----------------

* Create an account on the Coop
* Create EDSL objects: questions, surveys, agents, results
* Post objects to the Coop
* Choose the visibility of your objects: 
  - Public: Share with everyone
  - Private: Share with no one 
  - Unlisted: Share with people who have the link
* Search for other users' content by object type, keyword, author, topic, etc.
* Copy code and examples to your own workspace to modify or rerun them.
* Share feedback and suggestions with other users!
