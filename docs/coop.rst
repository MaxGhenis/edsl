*Coming soon!*


What is it?
-----------

The Coop is a platform for storing your work and sharing projects and ideas with other researchers.



How does it work?
-----------------

Store and share your work in the Coop by creating EDSL objects and posting them.
You can also explore other users' work by searching for objects and users.

Posting content 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Create EDSL objects: questions, surveys, agents, results 
2. Post objects to the Coop
4. Choose the visibility of your objects: 
   - Public: Share with everyone
   - Private: Share with no one 
   - Unlisted: Share with people who have the link


Exploring content 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Search for other users' content by object type, keyword, author, date, etc.
2. Copy code and examples to your own workspace to modify or rerun them.
3. Sharefeedback and suggestions with other users!
