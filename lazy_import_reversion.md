# Reverting Lazy Imports Checklist

This document tracks the progress of reverting the lazy import system back to standard imports.

## Status Summary

Based on the investigation and testing, we found that:
1. The main `__init__.py` is already using standard imports (not lazy imports)
2. The lazy import modules exist but don't seem to be actively used in the codebase except for test scripts and experimental code
3. No submodule `__init__.py` files seem to be using the lazy import system
4. Tests are passing with no references to the lazy import modules
5. It appears safe to remove the lazy import modules and related files

## Main Package Structure

- [x] Create checklist markdown file
- [x] Create backup of current `__init__.py` file
- [x] Verify main `__init__.py` already uses standard implementation
- [x] Remove `__init__lazy.py` file after verification is complete

## Utility Files

- [x] Remove or archive `lazy_import.py` utility
- [x] Remove or archive `lazy_edsl.py` and `lazy_edsl_init.py`

## Sub-Modules with Lazy Imports

### Clean up lazy import modules
- [x] Remove `edsl/dataset/lazy_imports.py` (appears unused)
- [x] Remove `edsl/scenarios/lazy_imports.py` (appears unused)
- [x] Remove `edsl/surveys/lazy_imports.py` (appears unused)
- [x] Remove `edsl/surveys/survey_flow_visualization_lazy.py` (unused - regular version at `survey_flow_visualization.py` is already using standard imports)

### Check for any remaining lazy import usage
- [x] Run tests to verify no functionality depends on lazy imports
- [x] Search for any references to lazy imports in the codebase that may have been missed
- [x] Check for internal lazy loading implementations in other modules

## Testing

- [x] Run tests after each major change to verify functionality
- [x] Run comprehensive test suite after all changes are complete

## Documentation

- [x] No changes needed - documentation didn't explicitly reference lazy imports

## Conclusion

The lazy import system has been successfully removed from the codebase. All lazy import related files have been moved to the `temp_step` directory for reference. We found that:

1. The main `__init__.py` was already using standard imports, not lazy imports
2. The codebase wasn't actively using the lazy import system in production code
3. All tests pass after removing the lazy import files
4. No documentation updates were needed

The changes have been performed with minimal risk as the system was already primarily using standard imports. This simplifies the codebase and eliminates any confusion between the lazy and standard import approaches.
