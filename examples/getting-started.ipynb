    "\n",
    "There are three ways to provide your API keys to EDSL:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Setting the environment variables directly\n",
    "In your script, start with the following lines before importing EDSL:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "os.environ[\"OPEN_AI_API_KEY\"] = \"your-key-here\"\n",
    "os.environ[\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\"] = \"your-key-here\"\n",
    "os.environ[\"DEEP_INFRA_API_KEY\"] = \"your-key-here\" \n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that when using this method, you will have to provide your API keys every time you run your script.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Using a .env file\n",
    "In your current working directory, create a file called `.env` and add the following lines:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "OPEN_AI_API_KEY=your-key-here\n",
    "GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-key-here\n",
    "DEEP_INFRA_API_KEY=your-key-here\n",
    "```\n",
    "Using this method will allow you to run your script without having to provide your API keys every time. However, be careful to not accidentally share your `.env` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Provide your keys to EDSL directly\n",
    "Upon importing any of the EDSL modules, you will be asked to provide your API keys. You will be asked for all three keys, but you can skip any of them by pressing enter.\n",
